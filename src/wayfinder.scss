/** CLIPPING AND DISABLE MOBILE X-SCROLL MIXINS
*
* note: the original reason I made these clipping mixins was to remove horizontal scrolling on mobile if travelers extended past the edge of the screen
* The way the standard implemented 'overflow-x: hidden' sucks and there aren't any other simple ways to get width-only clipping.
* instead, I've found it's best to enable full clipping and just make sure that the height of the container doesn't get in the way
* 
* in order for the wayfinder to clip at the edge of the screen, it needs to fill the body's width. this is not the default behavior,
* since the wayfinder is 'positioned.' A positioned element with width and height set to 100% will fill its most recent
* *positioned* ancestor
*
* a couple mixin options are provided below to prep the body element for wayfinder clipping
* 
* of course, if you want to clip to something other than the actual page then you don't have to use those particular mixins, although the technique
* will probably be the same
